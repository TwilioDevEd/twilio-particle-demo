# Twilio Particle Integration Demos

In this repositorty we'll demonstrate using [Particle devices](https://particle.io) with Twilio.  Enter the directory for the device you're using to see our examples:

* `/Electron` : Particle Electron
* `/Photon` : Particle Photon

We also have an example of a [SMS to Morse Code Translation Application](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/06/sms-morse-code-translator-twilio-particle-electron.html) on a Particle Electron.
